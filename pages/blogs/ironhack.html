						<h3>Day 45: It's all over now</h3>
						<p>Today's the day, the final day.  So even though we presented yesterday, our real final projects were not due until Friday morning to submit in front of the judges. So last night I started going through all of my code and cleaning it up, I had a lot of duplicated or nonfunctional code. I also had to clean up a lot of my styling because I only really had basic styling just to get the layout working.</p>
						<p>I spent time cleaning each page and component one by one. It was nice doing this, because it helped me understand my code better and I caught some errors and duplicates. Also I was kinda upset because even though I completed my MVP, I didn't push as hard as I could've. I really imagined my final project being way more impressive than it wound up being. But the reason I was okay with not adding any extra wow features was because I really wanted to learn and understand what I was doing. And because I didn't rush and try and complete everything, I felt that I could actually understand what was going on. It took a while for everything to click, but once it did it was worth it.</p>
						<p>But you can't help but look around at other people and see how amazing their work is and feel inferior. Only three people would be selected and I knew that I would be in fourth place. There were three people in our class that had amazing projects that were completed and complex. Mine was completed, minimalist but had no wow factor. So I knew unless I added a cool new feature I would never be able to get into the top three. So I was okay with making the best final product I could.</p>
						<p>So the final day starts and we met some of the judges, who were all from different areas in the tech community. Then we had to explain our app and code to each judge or pair of judges for 7 minutes. After that we moved to the next judge and repeated. We had to do this five times. The first time I went it felt much easier because the second time it just feels like you're repeating yourself. Also my local app crashed during my presentation but luckily I had my full app deployed on heroku. It didn't have the most up to date code, but it did everything I needed it to. Some of the judges were interested in the code, some in the design, and others in the backend or frontend. So you had to adjust to each judge. But it was really hard to do in a short amount of time.</p>
						<p>After everyone went, we waited for them to decide the winners. And as predicted the 3 people I thought would win, did. Then after the announcement multiple judges came up and told me that I was among the top projects but they could only chose three, so that's why I didn't make it. I was 100% ok with that, my other classmates deserved it way more than me, they had better apps and code. But it felt nice to know that the work that I did was respected and understood. Then because I didn't get picked, I could go leave and relax because the three winners had to prepare for their final pitch to the public. The final projects were presented and Jennie won, with her project Sailaroo, which was just amazing and I loved her app, and she worked very hard and deserved it. The best part is we always worked together, so being friends with the winner, is the second best thing to winning.<p>

						<h3>Day 44: Finishing Touches</h3>
						<p>I had to start today with the understanding that if I can't get any new features working before lunch time, they would need to be cut from the final demo. This is because as soon as I try to add new features, I tend to break other ones. So instead of trying to get everything done last minute, I need to focus on cleaning up and structuring all my existing code.</p>
						<p>So the first thing I tried was to start passing the user id as a parameter so you could view other people's profiles. This presented a new issue because this needed context to know if you were on your profile or not. I understood that I could do that, but as soon as I started, I realized I could not get this user story to done by the end of the day, so I compromised. I created a global feed that allows any user to see all the posts that exist on my service. Then when you go to your profile you can see just your posts and blogs. The hope is to be able to click on the posts in the feed and go to that user's profile. Also be able to follow people and customize your feed as well as be able to keep posts private and add blogs to a feed. </p>
						<p>I was able to get the global feed thing working pretty easily, but I couldn't pass the username, only the user id. So it's not perfect but it's usable. After I got that done, I started bug squashing because I was still having some display glitches. Then it was time to deploy. There were always errors with this, but luckily our teacher was able to walk us through it and I was able to get my app live and running with the database working. For now the app only works on mobile, but it still works on heroku. After we came back from lunch, I started cleaning my code up, because I had a lot of unnecessary stuff leftover. We then presented our apps to our class which was nice to see what everyone was working on, but it was kind of sad because it is all coming to an end. Tomorrow is the end, we pitch to the judges and then the final three present, and then we are released into the real world.<p>

						<h3>Day 43: Accepting Reality</h3>
						<p>I woke up today in a bad mood. I think I was just so stressed about finishing my final project and the anxiety that this program ending, so I just couldn't relax. So I decided to just sleep in another hour and hope that when I woke up I'd be in a better mood, and it worked. I realized that morning that there was no way I would be able to get everything in my app I wanted done on time. Also I was just very frustrated with my design and layout, that I just felt unaccomplished and demotivated. So I just decided to finish my MVP and understand everything I created and how it works.</p>
						<p>It's hard being around other talented people to not compare yourself to them. I look around and see all these amazing projects and I just feel like mine can be so much better. Then I remembered that I came to this bootcamp to boost my knowledge and skills, not to have the best design or to create my own startup, but rather just learn the skills I need to be an asset to any dev team or company. I can’t expect to make a complete clone of medium in two weeks. </p>
						<p>So when I entered class today I set my mind on finishing the final step of my app, which is to see all the posts that belong to a blog, and also only see posts that belong to that blog. So I talked it out with someone, so I could see what I had to do. Because my databases were designed with zero redundancy, I had to make sure all my searches were perfect. I realized I needed to use the id of the blog I clicked on as the filter value for my GET request and then it should show all posts that belong to that blog….and viola….it actually worked.</p>
						<p>I was so happy and proud of myself. I actually understood what I needed to do, and did it. This is when I felt much better about my app, because as long as I know what I'm doing, I don't care if my app is perfect or not. After that I went and started fixing some bugs and fixed my routing. I then decided to ask a friend to help me with the photo upload because she was able to do it. That also proved to be more difficult than expected. The way I was uploading a photo was in an edit form and the photo data wasn’t being saved in time for the form update. So I restructured the form and the function and got it to work. Then it wasn't displaying but it was because there was no directory set in the back end for static files. In the end I was able to finish it before the day was over.</p>

						<h3>Day 42: Console Cleaning</h3>
						<p> For the first two projects and most of the bootcamp I haven't really asked the TA's or teachers for help. Mostly because I'm just a person that likes to figure stuff out myself and I realized the most valuable skill as a developer is to learn how to learn on your own. But of course, there were times that I was just stuck or had no idea, and I almost always asked a friend or partner and they could help. But because Angular is new to all of us, there are some questions that can only be answered by someone experienced. </p>
						<p>So I had a list of bugs and errors in my console that needed addressing. So, I got the teacher to go through them all, and there were so many tiny errors that were compounding and making everything worse. As he showed me them, it became obvious what my mistakes were and that I had some things working by luck. It just goes to show that sometimes you need perspective to see your code with clarity. </p>
						<p>Now I had blogs and posts, but I needed a way to add the post to a blog if you want. I had this with a drop down that showed all created blogs, and it was working. Now I just wanted to pass the id of the selected blog to the POST document so it would save the blog id. I was on the right track, but the teacher helped me solve it and it worked right away. It felt nice to just solve a bunch of errors at once and just clean everything up.</p>

						<h3>Day 41: Blog Time</h3>
						<p>I did some work on the weekend, tweaking the style, creating the navbar and the left side pop out navigation menu. So, I came in Monday morning with some new components and I needed to add some extra functionality to them. I needed the side menu to change depending on if you were logged in or not. I was able to do that and have the proper links displaying easily. I then moved the logout function to navbar, so you can logout whenever you want. The biggest thing I needed to do for today was to create the blog service. It isn't much of a blogging app without the ability to create blogs and add posts to your blogs. </p>
						<p>I updated the blog model on the backend and frontend. Then I created the blog route on the backend that was very similar to the post route. Then all I had to do on the front end was to make the Blog service with Angular to be able to do all the backend calls to my database. This wasn’t too bad, because it was very similar to everything I had already done with the posts. The only difference is that you’re able to click on blogs and see that blog in a separate page. This meant I had to pass along the blog id as a parameter so that I could get the data of that blog in the blog page. Luckily one of our learning units had an example that I was able to follow and after some tweaking I was able to get to work. The only thing was that I didn’t have a form to create a blog. So, I just created a separate form to create a blog so that I could see a list of my created blogs and be able to click on each one and see it on a separate page. </p>

						<h3>Day 40: First part of the app down..so much more to go.</h3>
						<p>I spent most of the week structuring my app, I thought I would have a lot of the basic functionality working by now, so that I could focus on design and flow the second week. Wrong....oh so wrong. I did not anticipate that passport and the whole login/logout would take 2 days to get working. So, my biggest focus for today was to get the form to create a post to your account working, as this is the core aspect of my app.</p>
						<p>I started on the backend with model and everything I needed for the post. I have it structured so that the posts are a separate collection and just store the userId of the current person logged in. I then had to write the route for the post. All of this was okay because I had done it before. The hard part was Angular. Because you must create a service and then call that service in the components. Then you have to make the form in Angular using ngModels and having a handleFormSubmit function.</p>
						<p>All this stuff isolated makes sense, but when you have to create and write in like 5 separate files just to simply add something to the database, it can be a bit overwhelming. So, after taking a while to get that all written of course I had spelling mistakes and errors that I had to go and correct. Then nothing happened. After some troubleshooting, I realized I hadn't imported the data model for user on the backend so that it wasn't adding the current user's id to their posts, and this broke everything. Nothing would be added to the database until this was fixed.</p>
						<p>With that working I was able to display the posts in the profile that were created in the form. The issue was these posts were global, not just the ones that are part of your profile. I then had to filter the GET all posts function by userId. So, before the day was over I had the core functionality of my app working. There still is no way to add that post to a blog or see other people's posts, but I felt accomplished. Then we had to watch the UX/UI's final presentations, so I was basically done for the day at 3pm. Next week is going to be a lot of stress!</p>

						<h3>Day 39: Passport Problems</h3>
						<p>Today I spent most of the day just being frustrated. Even though we learned the backend in a short amount of time, I felt that I was able actually understand everything. And when we did the project we had direction and an idea of what to do. Now with Angular, how we use the backend is different. It is just a web API for our data, which in concept is fine. But when we generated views in the backend it was easy to understand how to get the data and display it. Now we have to handle the routes on the backend and frontend, and they are in two different syntaxes.</p>
						<p>Then you have to make sure your service is accurate and passed to all the components that need it. Also passport was pretty easy for me on the backend. But now that we have to pass that information to the frontend and allow Angular to know if the user is logged in or not. So I had the login/signup working but I didn’t understand how it worked. I mean I get the theory but all the code that is needed to make it work on the frontend just confuses me.</p>
						<p>Then we had to create other functions so that when you redirect the next page would have the data it needs. Then we also had to destroy the service when the component was no longer being used. So I just felt like I had no idea what I was doing, and I was very demotivated. I love the frontend and creating beautiful functional apps, but I feel like I'm not actually using the power of Angular because I am so frustrated with passport and keeping track of if the user is signed in or not.</p>

						<h3>Day 38: Time to actually code</h3>
						<p>I spent the first two days thinking through my app, creating wireframes and organizing the files. But I hadn't actually written any code the first two days. I started the day off creating the models in the front and back end and generating all the pages, components and services I needed. I then created the welcome, login and signup pages in Angular. I had to then create the routes and link them together, and everything actually worked. </p>
						<p>I was happy because I had three pages of my app done, but they didn't actually do anything. So then I was stuck between whether I should work on the login/signup process or start on some forms to see if I can get the data added to the database and display it with Angular. I decided to try and do the login/signup because it was very easy for me with passport on the backend with express. </p>
						<p>I learned very quickly that it is not easy at all on Angular. I needed to have the service, then the routes and authorized routes. Then I needed to have all the passport configuration in the backend and also a way to create sessions and allow all the components of Angular to know the status of the user. Luckily our teacher created an example on GitHub for us to use, but even with that I was still getting errors. So after the day was over, a few of us stayed after and worked on it together with someone who had it working. After a few hours and some beers, the login and sign up function was working!!</p>

						<h3>Day 37: Too much to do, too little time</h3>
						<p>So it's day two of our final projects and the panic is starting to set in a little more. I finished up the wireframes and user flow for mobile, then once that was done I did the wireframes for the desktop. As I did this I realized I don't even like my design that much, especially for desktop because it's just basically a blown up mobile version. But I don't really have time to completely redesign the layout, so I just need to focus on making everything work and being consistent, then I can style once the program is over.</p>
						<p>Now that I have how the app would look and work, I needed to generate the app for the frontend and backend. I wanted to make sure I created them correctly the first time. I made sure to create the Angular app using Sass to make it easier than changing it later. Then I had to create the express app and delete all the parts I wouldn't need and add all the extra files I would need to handle the authorization. After I did this, I went to push them to their separate github repos, but I accidentally pushed the front and back to the frontend repo. So I had to spend time fixing all that.</p>
						<p>Then after that I somehow deleted the gitignore so the node modules were pushed as well, so I had to fix that. The final thing I did for the day was to create my data models for my app which are currently user, post and blog. I spent time making sure I had everything I needed in the model and that it wasn't redundant and that everything I needed could be accessed using just the user id. By this time the day was over and I was getting stressed because I realized how much stuff I have to do, and I don't have enough time. What happens with these projects is that a little bug can appear and consume your whole day.</p>

						<h3>Day 36: Well hello there...</h3>
						<p>Today marks the start of our two weeks to work on our final project. So if everything goes according to plan you will be reading this post on my app. Awkward….I have been just writing all these posts in a word document because there wasn't a simple blogging platform that I liked. Medium is probably the closest to what I like, but it is more for article or one off publications, it's not really the best for blog creation. So my idea, as you should already know was to have the single post idea still supported but group them into blogs. This way you can just post your thoughts but add that post to a blog if you want so you can group your thoughts and allow people to see all the grouped posts. The hardest part was and still is the core functionality and layout. Because I want to keep it simple and easy to use, but also functional. There are so many features I want to have but with only two weeks I need to keep focused.</p>

						<h3>Day 35: It's all coming to an end</h3>
						<p>Today is the last day of our learning modules. We still have some content to cover on Monday but we will not be learning all day, we have to start our projects. Today we just worked on yesterday's daily exercise about recipes using the client and server. This wound up taking almost the entire day. The daily exercise wasn’t actually that hard it was just getting familiar with the setup of having a client and server. The server was already setup for us, which is the part I needed to practice more. So we just needed to be able to create routes passing the data through using services but have it linked the backend API. So it was just a lot of mistakes and errors in passing through all the data as usual. I would have everything set up correctly but it wouldn’t work because I was just missing one curly brace in the HTML. And eventually we were able to get things posted in the database using a form and button. And while it seems so simple, it took a lot of effort. I think I just need to start working on my project so I learn all this better by doing.</p>

						<h3>Day 34: My brain is full</h3>
						<p>Today we went started with the pair programming from yesterday because we didn’t get to it. It was basically the same as the daily exercise we did yesterday, so I already knew how to do it. The only difference is that this one had a form and we had to use Angular's form method to get everything from the form and allow it to execute a function. This was difficult because we never learned it. So we went over it as a class, and it wasn't too bad, but again it was just a bunch of new specific syntax rules that we weren't used to. Then we switched to under sting how this would work with our REST API and router on the backend. How we were going to pass all the data from a database to our angular front end. This was something that was fine in theory but once we started the coding, I just couldn't follow it. It was just too much information and my brain shut down. I need to just play around with it myself to learn, but now I just need a break to practice.</p>

						<h3>Day 33: Ok, now it's getting complicated</h3>
						<p>So far everything we did in Angular wasn't super difficult. It was usually similar to things we did on the front end static design or on the backend with express. It just added some new syntax or a way of doing something, but it wasn't anything super crazy, just took some practice. But today we just built a trello style to-do app with Angular but it included a lot of new concepts. Using pipes, services, models, pages and components.</p>
						<p>So we had learned a lot of these separately but not all together. One at a time it wasn't too difficult, but linking everything together and passing all the data through, and thinking about the parent and child components just added a lot of complexity. So our daily exercise for that day was focused just mainly on services and routes. Luckily we did the example in class because we were able to get all of the daily exercise done by referencing that app. The hardest part was remembering all the new syntax to use in the html and also importing and using the service. The routing wasn't too bad because we only had one page that linked to another based off id.</p>

						<h3>Day 32: It's just getting started</h3>
						<p>Today continued the learning of Angular. So far everything we have done in Angular hasn't been that bad, it has just been a different way of doing the same things we already did. So I was able to do yesterday's daily exercise pretty easily but today we started adding more complexity. Most of it wasn't too bad until we started talking about pipes. It's already a lot of work keeping track of all the folders and components of angular, then using pipes to manipulate the data adds another layer.</p>
						<p>We walked through a lot of features of Angular together as a class, but I already started the daily exercise and noticed that we need a search filter, which would be a pipe. This is where the pipes started to confuse me. We were able to create a pipe that if you typed in the name of a food item that is identical to one in the saved data array, it will display, but it wouldn't work with partials. This is where I don't know if I just need to write more JavaScript code or if Angular has a way to make this easier. That is where the difficulty begins, knowing what Angular can help with and what we need to just do ourselves.</p>

						<h3>Day 31: Angular</h3>
						<p>I really wanted to learn the MEAN stack because I have always been interested in the front end and really wanted to learn front-end frameworks especially Angular and React. Those are quite intimidating to a new learner, so that was a big factor in my joining the boot camp. So now that we did the MEN part of the stack we learned how to make apps but using the server to generate everything instead of relying on the frontend. Today we learned TypeScript which is what Angular uses throughout its framework.</p>
						<p>TypeScript is cool but it's always a lot of work to switch to something new. Then we looked at an already created Angular app, and there were so many files and folders. But after playing around and creating some components it started to make sense. Overall it wasn't too bad but I don't think we really scratched the surface of what Angular can do. The daily exercise dipped my toe in the water, but I'm excited to create an entire SPA using Angular.</p>
