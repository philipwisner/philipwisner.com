						<h3>Day 45: It's all over now</h3>
						<p>Today's the day, the final day.  So even though we presented yesterday, our real final projects were not due until Friday morning to submit in front of the judges. So last night I started going through all of my code and cleaning it up, I had a lot of duplicated or nonfunctional code. I also had to clean up a lot of my styling because I only really had basic styling just to get the layout working.</p>
						<p>I spent time cleaning each page and component one by one. It was nice doing this, because it helped me understand my code better and I caught some errors and duplicates. Also I was kinda upset because even though I completed my MVP, I didn't push as hard as I could've. I really imagined my final project being way more impressive than it wound up being. But the reason I was okay with not adding any extra wow features was because I really wanted to learn and understand what I was doing. And because I didn't rush and try and complete everything, I felt that I could actually understand what was going on. It took a while for everything to click, but once it did it was worth it.</p>
						<p>But you can't help but look around at other people and see how amazing their work is and feel inferior. Only three people would be selected and I knew that I would be in fourth place. There were three people in our class that had amazing projects that were completed and complex. Mine was completed, minimalist but had no wow factor. So I knew unless I added a cool new feature I would never be able to get into the top three. So I was okay with making the best final product I could.</p>
						<p>So the final day starts and we met some of the judges, who were all from different areas in the tech community. Then we had to explain our app and code to each judge or pair of judges for 7 minutes. After that we moved to the next judge and repeated. We had to do this five times. The first time I went it felt much easier because the second time it just feels like you're repeating yourself. Also my local app crashed during my presentation but luckily I had my full app deployed on heroku. It didn't have the most up to date code, but it did everything I needed it to. Some of the judges were interested in the code, some in the design, and others in the backend or frontend. So you had to adjust to each judge. But it was really hard to do in a short amount of time.</p>
						<p>After everyone went, we waited for them to decide the winners. And as predicted the 3 people I thought would win, did. Then after the announcement multiple judges came up and told me that I was among the top projects but they could only chose three, so that's why I didn't make it. I was 100% ok with that, my other classmates deserved it way more than me, they had better apps and code. But it felt nice to know that the work that I did was respected and understood. Then because I didn't get picked, I could go leave and relax because the three winners had to prepare for their final pitch to the public. The final projects were presented and Jennie won, with her project Sailaroo, which was just amazing and I loved her app, and she worked very hard and deserved it. The best part is we always worked together, so being friends with the winner, is the second best thing to winning.<p>

							<h4>Takeaways:</h4>
							<p>I never thought the time would fly by this fast, and that I'd have so much fun spending 12 hours a day coding on a computer. I wouldn't trade this experience for anything. I had an amazing time!</p>
							<p>Now to see what the future holds.</p>
