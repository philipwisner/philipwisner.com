						<h3>Day 45: It's all over now</h3>
						<p>Today's the day, the final day.  So even though we presented yesterday, our real final projects were not due until Friday morning to submit in front of the judges. So last night I started going through all of my code and cleaning it up, I had a lot of duplicated or nonfunctional code. I also had to clean up a lot of my styling because I only really had basic styling just to get the layout working.</p>
						<p>I spent time cleaning each page and component one by one. It was nice doing this, because it helped me understand my code better and I caught some errors and duplicates. Also I was kinda upset because even though I completed my MVP, I didn't push as hard as I could've. I really imagined my final project being way more impressive than it wound up being. But the reason I was okay with not adding any extra wow features was because I really wanted to learn and understand what I was doing. And because I didn't rush and try and complete everything, I felt that I could actually understand what was going on. It took a while for everything to click, but once it did it was worth it.</p>
						<p>But you can't help but look around at other people and see how amazing their work is and feel inferior. Only three people would be selected and I knew that I would be in fourth place. There were three people in our class that had amazing projects that were completed and complex. Mine was completed, minimalist but had no wow factor. So I knew unless I added a cool new feature I would never be able to get into the top three. So I was okay with making the best final product I could.</p>
						<p>So the final day starts and we met some of the judges, who were all from different areas in the tech community. Then we had to explain our app and code to each judge or pair of judges for 7 minutes. After that we moved to the next judge and repeated. We had to do this five times. The first time I went it felt much easier because the second time it just feels like you're repeating yourself. Also my local app crashed during my presentation but luckily I had my full app deployed on heroku. It didn't have the most up to date code, but it did everything I needed it to. Some of the judges were interested in the code, some in the design, and others in the backend or frontend. So you had to adjust to each judge. But it was really hard to do in a short amount of time.</p>
						<p>After everyone went, we waited for them to decide the winners. And as predicted the 3 people I thought would win, did. Then after the announcement multiple judges came up and told me that I was among the top projects but they could only chose three, so that's why I didn't make it. I was 100% ok with that, my other classmates deserved it way more than me, they had better apps and code. But it felt nice to know that the work that I did was respected and understood. Then because I didn't get picked, I could go leave and relax because the three winners had to prepare for their final pitch to the public. The final projects were presented and Jennie won, with her project Sailaroo, which was just amazing and I loved her app, and she worked very hard and deserved it. The best part is we always worked together, so being friends with the winner, is the second best thing to winning.<p>

						<h3>Day 44: Finishing Touches</h3>
						<p>I had to start today with the understanding that if I can't get any new features working before lunch time, they would need to be cut from the final demo. This is because as soon as I try to add new features, I tend to break other ones. So instead of trying to get everything done last minute, I need to focus on cleaning up and structuring all my existing code.</p>
						<p>So the first thing I tried was to start passing the user id as a parameter so you could view other people's profiles. This presented a new issue because this needed context to know if you were on your profile or not. I understood that I could do that, but as soon as I started, I realized I could not get this user story to done by the end of the day, so I compromised. I created a global feed that allows any user to see all the posts that exist on my service. Then when you go to your profile you can see just your posts and blogs. The hope is to be able to click on the posts in the feed and go to that user's profile. Also be able to follow people and customize your feed as well as be able to keep posts private and add blogs to a feed. </p>
						<p>I was able to get the global feed thing working pretty easily, but I couldn't pass the username, only the user id. So it's not perfect but it's usable. After I got that done, I started bug squashing because I was still having some display glitches. Then it was time to deploy. There were always errors with this, but luckily our teacher was able to walk us through it and I was able to get my app live and running with the database working. For now the app only works on mobile, but it still works on heroku. After we came back from lunch, I started cleaning my code up, because I had a lot of unnecessary stuff leftover. We then presented our apps to our class which was nice to see what everyone was working on, but it was kind of sad because it is all coming to an end. Tomorrow is the end, we pitch to the judges and then the final three present, and then we are released into the real world.<p>

						<h3>Day 43: Accepting Reality</h3>
						<p>I woke up today in a bad mood. I think I was just so stressed about finishing my final project and the anxiety that this program ending, so I just couldn't relax. So I decided to just sleep in another hour and hope that when I woke up I'd be in a better mood, and it worked. I realized that morning that there was no way I would be able to get everything in my app I wanted done on time. Also I was just very frustrated with my design and layout, that I just felt unaccomplished and demotivated. So I just decided to finish my MVP and understand everything I created and how it works.</p>
						<p>It's hard being around other talented people to not compare yourself to them. I look around and see all these amazing projects and I just feel like mine can be so much better. Then I remembered that I came to this bootcamp to boost my knowledge and skills, not to have the best design or to create my own startup, but rather just learn the skills I need to be an asset to any dev team or company. I can’t expect to make a complete clone of medium in two weeks. </p>
						<p>So when I entered class today I set my mind on finishing the final step of my app, which is to see all the posts that belong to a blog, and also only see posts that belong to that blog. So I talked it out with someone, so I could see what I had to do. Because my databases were designed with zero redundancy, I had to make sure all my searches were perfect. I realized I needed to use the id of the blog I clicked on as the filter value for my GET request and then it should show all posts that belong to that blog….and viola….it actually worked.</p>
						<p>I was so happy and proud of myself. I actually understood what I needed to do, and did it. This is when I felt much better about my app, because as long as I know what I'm doing, I don't care if my app is perfect or not. After that I went and started fixing some bugs and fixed my routing. I then decided to ask a friend to help me with the photo upload because she was able to do it. That also proved to be more difficult than expected. The way I was uploading a photo was in an edit form and the photo data wasn’t being saved in time for the form update. So I restructured the form and the function and got it to work. Then it wasn't displaying but it was because there was no directory set in the back end for static files. In the end I was able to finish it before the day was over.</p>

						<h3>Day 42: Console Cleaning</h3>
						<p> For the first two projects and most of the bootcamp I haven't really asked the TA's or teachers for help. Mostly because I'm just a person that likes to figure stuff out myself and I realized the most valuable skill as a developer is to learn how to learn on your own. But of course, there were times that I was just stuck or had no idea, and I almost always asked a friend or partner and they could help. But because Angular is new to all of us, there are some questions that can only be answered by someone experienced. </p>
						<p>So I had a list of bugs and errors in my console that needed addressing. So, I got the teacher to go through them all, and there were so many tiny errors that were compounding and making everything worse. As he showed me them, it became obvious what my mistakes were and that I had some things working by luck. It just goes to show that sometimes you need perspective to see your code with clarity. </p>
						<p>Now I had blogs and posts, but I needed a way to add the post to a blog if you want. I had this with a drop down that showed all created blogs, and it was working. Now I just wanted to pass the id of the selected blog to the POST document so it would save the blog id. I was on the right track, but the teacher helped me solve it and it worked right away. It felt nice to just solve a bunch of errors at once and just clean everything up.</p>

						<h3>Day 41: Blog Time</h3>
						<p>
					I did some work on the weekend, tweaking the style, creating the navbar and the left side pop out navigation menu. So, I came in Monday morning with some new components and I needed to add some extra functionality to them. I needed the side menu to change depending on if you were logged in or not. I was able to do that and have the proper links displaying easily. I then moved the logout function to navbar, so you can logout whenever you want. The biggest thing I needed to do for today was to create the blog service. It isn't much of a blogging app without the ability to create blogs and add posts to your blogs. </p>
					<p>I updated the blog model on the backend and frontend. Then I created the blog route on the backend that was very similar to the post route. Then all I had to do on the front end was to make the Blog service with Angular to be able to do all the backend calls to my database. This wasn’t too bad, because it was very similar to everything I had already done with the posts. The only difference is that you’re able to click on blogs and see that blog in a separate page. This meant I had to pass along the blog id as a parameter so that I could get the data of that blog in the blog page. Luckily one of our learning units had an example that I was able to follow and after some tweaking I was able to get to work. The only thing was that I didn’t have a form to create a blog. So, I just created a separate form to create a blog so that I could see a list of my created blogs and be able to click on each one and see it on a separate page. </p>

						<h3>Day 40: First part of the app down..so much more to go.</h3>
						<p>I spent most of the week structuring my app, I thought I would have a lot of the basic functionality working by now, so that I could focus on design and flow the second week. Wrong....oh so wrong. I did not anticipate that passport and the whole login/logout would take 2 days to get working. So, my biggest focus for today was to get the form to create a post to your account working, as this is the core aspect of my app.</p>
						<p>I started on the backend with model and everything I needed for the post. I have it structured so that the posts are a separate collection and just store the userId of the current person logged in. I then had to write the route for the post. All of this was okay because I had done it before. The hard part was Angular. Because you must create a service and then call that service in the components. Then you have to make the form in Angular using ngModels and having a handleFormSubmit function.</p>
						<p>All this stuff isolated makes sense, but when you have to create and write in like 5 separate files just to simply add something to the database, it can be a bit overwhelming. So, after taking a while to get that all written of course I had spelling mistakes and errors that I had to go and correct. Then nothing happened. After some troubleshooting, I realized I hadn't imported the data model for user on the backend so that it wasn't adding the current user's id to their posts, and this broke everything. Nothing would be added to the database until this was fixed.</p>
						<p>With that working I was able to display the posts in the profile that were created in the form. The issue was these posts were global, not just the ones that are part of your profile. I then had to filter the GET all posts function by userId. So, before the day was over I had the core functionality of my app working. There still is no way to add that post to a blog or see other people's posts, but I felt accomplished. Then we had to watch the UX/UI's final presentations, so I was basically done for the day at 3pm. Next week is going to be a lot of stress!</p>

						<h3>Day 39: Passport Problems</h3>
						<p>Today I spent most of the day just being frustrated. Even though we learned the backend in a short amount of time, I felt that I was able actually understand everything. And when we did the project we had direction and an idea of what to do. Now with Angular, how we use the backend is different. It is just a web API for our data, which in concept is fine. But when we generated views in the backend it was easy to understand how to get the data and display it. Now we have to handle the routes on the backend and frontend, and they are in two different syntaxes.</p>
						<p>Then you have to make sure your service is accurate and passed to all the components that need it. Also passport was pretty easy for me on the backend. But now that we have to pass that information to the frontend and allow Angular to know if the user is logged in or not. So I had the login/signup working but I didn’t understand how it worked. I mean I get the theory but all the code that is needed to make it work on the frontend just confuses me.</p>
						<p>Then we had to create other functions so that when you redirect the next page would have the data it needs. Then we also had to destroy the service when the component was no longer being used. So I just felt like I had no idea what I was doing, and I was very demotivated. I love the frontend and creating beautiful functional apps, but I feel like I'm not actually using the power of Angular because I am so frustrated with passport and keeping track of if the user is signed in or not.</p>

						<h3>Day 38: Time to actually code</h3>
						<p>I spent the first two days thinking through my app, creating wireframes and organizing the files. But I hadn't actually written any code the first two days. I started the day off creating the models in the front and back end and generating all the pages, components and services I needed. I then created the welcome, login and signup pages in Angular. I had to then create the routes and link them together, and everything actually worked. </p>
						<p>I was happy because I had three pages of my app done, but they didn't actually do anything. So then I was stuck between whether I should work on the login/signup process or start on some forms to see if I can get the data added to the database and display it with Angular. I decided to try and do the login/signup because it was very easy for me with passport on the backend with express. </p>
						<p>I learned very quickly that it is not easy at all on Angular. I needed to have the service, then the routes and authorized routes. Then I needed to have all the passport configuration in the backend and also a way to create sessions and allow all the components of Angular to know the status of the user. Luckily our teacher created an example on GitHub for us to use, but even with that I was still getting errors. So after the day was over, a few of us stayed after and worked on it together with someone who had it working. After a few hours and some beers, the login and sign up function was working!!</p>
