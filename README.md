>My personal website built from scratch...a perpetual work in progress.

## Introduction
* Creating my personal website has been and will continue to be an ongoing battle. It is impossible to be satisfied no matter how much I do. But I finally have a functioning live version of my website that displays all the stuff I have done. So please take a look and feel free to give feedback.

## See it live
* Check out my personal website [here](http://philipwisner.com)

## Development
* I used Figma to create my wireframes and protoype (here)[https://www.figmaom/proto/TMQVcGsKrzKSEVduRJeW2Tae/philipwisner.com?scaling=contain&node-id=1%3A500].
* I used Sass to do all my styling
* Many, many media queries to make the website as responsive as possible
* Fixed a lot of display issues in Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer
* Still adding content everyday.


## To-do
* Optimize mobile performance 
* Add new content
* Add blog posts
* Change to final design
* Add animations and transitions
