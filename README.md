>My personal website built from scratch...a perpetual work in progress.

## Introduction
* Farm Voyage (pronounced liked bon voyage) was created as our second project for Ironhack. We were tasked with making a full stack app MEN (without Angular) with at least 3 data models that also used an external API. Gabriele's family owns a farm in Italy, so he was interested in creating an app that let you find local farms, vineyards, ecolodges along a searched route. And so Farm Voyage was born.
* Currently only works in Italy.

## See it live

## Development
* We used Adobe Xd to create the wireframe and prototype our user flow.
* Checkout our wireframes [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/cXt9FG20cHbW3SKDexMcG9Eg/Farm-Voyage?scaling=contain&node-id=1%3A2&redirected=1).
* We used Passport to handle the local login/signup and the Google/Facebook signup.
* App built using Express running on Node with MongoDB. 
* Used Google Maps and Places API to retreive the business data.
* Check out our presentation [here](http://slides.com/philipwisner/farm-voyage/fullscreen).
